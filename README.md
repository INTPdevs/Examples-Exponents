Exponents and their divisors in many languages.

# ABOUT

This repository contains a bunch of ways to implement the following behaviour in various languages.

- Given a range between  `1` and `MAX_VALUE` that yields `I`
- Compute all exponents `BASE ^ I` where `(BASE ^ I) < MAX_VALUE and (BASE ^ I) divisible by DIVISOR`
